        "\n",
        "What we do here is supply it two numbers and `range` returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first number and up to the second number. For example, `range(1,5)` gives the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. By default, `range` takes a step count of 1. If we supply a third number to `range`, then that becomes the step count. For example, `range(1,5,2)` gives `[1,3]`. Remember that the range extends *up to* the second number i.e. it does *not* include the second number.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that `range()` generates only one number at a time, if you want the full list of numbers, call `list()` on the `range()`, for example, `list(range(5))` will result in `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. Lists are explained in the [data structures chapter](./data_structures.md#data-structures).\n",
        "\n",
        "The `for` loop then iterates over this range - `for i in range(1,5)` is equivalent to `for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]` which is like assigning each number (or object) in the sequence to i, one at a time, and then executing the block of statements for each value of `i`.  In this case, we just print the value in the block of statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that the `else` part is optional. When included, it is always executed once after the `for` loop is over unless a [break](#break-statement) statement is encountered.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that the `for..in` loop works for any sequence. Here, we have a list of numbers generated by the built-in `range` function, but in general we can use any kind of sequence of any kind of objects! We will explore this idea in detail in later chapters."

        "\n",
        "First, we see how to use indexes to get individual items of a sequence. This is also referred to as the _subscription operation_. Whenever you specify a number to a sequence within square brackets as shown above, Python will fetch you the item corresponding to that position in the sequence. Remember that Python starts counting numbers from 0. Hence, `shoplist[0]` fetches the first item and `shoplist[3]` fetches the fourth item in the `shoplist`sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The index can also be a negative number, in which case, the position is calculated from the end of the sequence. Therefore, `shoplist[-1]` refers to the last item in the sequence and `shoplist[-2]` fetches the second last item in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The slicing operation is used by specifying the name of the sequence followed by an optional pair of numbers separated by a colon within square brackets. Note that this is very similar to the indexing operation you have been using till now. Remember the numbers are optional but the colon isn't.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first number (before the colon) in the slicing operation refers to the position from where the slice starts and the second number (after the colon) indicates where the slice will stop at. If the first number is not specified, Python will start at the beginning of the sequence. If the second number is left out, Python will stop at the end of the sequence. Note that the slice returned _starts_ at the start position and will end just before the _end_ position i.e. the start position is included but the end position is excluded from the sequence slice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, `shoplist[1:3]` returns a slice of the sequence starting at position 1, includes position 2 but stops at position 3 and therefore a *slice* of two items is returned.  Similarly, `shoplist[:]` returns a copy of the whole sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also do slicing with negative positions. Negative numbers are used for positions from the end of the sequence. For example, `shoplist[:-1]` will return a slice of the sequence which excludes the last item of the sequence but contains everything else.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also provide a third argument for the slice, which is the _step_ for the slicing (by default, the step size is 1):\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        ">>> shoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\n",
        ">>> shoplist[::1]\n",
        "['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\n",
        ">>> shoplist[::2]\n",
        "['apple', 'carrot']\n",
        ">>> shoplist[::3]\n",

        ">>> shoplist[::-1]\n",
        "['banana', 'carrot', 'mango', 'apple']\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that when the step is 2, we get the items with position 0, 2,... When the step size is 3, we get the items with position 0, 3, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Try various combinations of such slice specifications using the Python interpreter interactively i.e. the prompt so that you can see the results immediately. The great thing about sequences is that you can access tuples, lists and strings all in the same way!\n",

        "## Set\n",
        "\n",
        "Sets are _unordered_ collections of simple objects. These are used when the existence of an object in a collection is more important than the order or how many times it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using sets, you can test for membership, whether it is a subset of another set, find the intersection between two sets, and so on.\n",

        "```python\n",
        ">>> bri = set(['brazil', 'russia', 'india'])\n",
        ">>> 'india' in bri\n",

        "\n",
